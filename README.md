Data from Round 6 of FSAE TTC tire testing at Calspan, May 2015.

Please download and read the file "Contents_Round6.pdf" before downloading the data. "RunGuide_Round6.pdf" will also be useful.

Data is provided in several different formats, each in separate *.zip files to help manage download size. Choose the one most approprate for you. "Run" files are different from "Raw" files in that the "Run" files do not contain data in the dwells between data sweeps. "Raw" files are like the "wPauses" files from Round 5, while "Run" files are like the "Raw" files from Round 5. In most cases you will find the smaller "Run" files sufficient for your analysis.

Note that the .zip files are very large. Be patient as the download will take several minutes.

Whatever data you choose to use, be sure to download "fromCalspan.zip". This contains the "Summary Tables" provided by Calspan with information such as tire weights and post-test carcass temperatures which are not found in the main data files. It also contains logos for your car's Calspan decal and other documents describing the Calspan Tire Research Facility.
